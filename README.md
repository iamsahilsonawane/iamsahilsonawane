### üöÄ What I Do  
**Building Custom Flutter Solutions:** I design and implement Flutter-based user interfaces that balance practicality and elegance, ensuring real-world usability.

**Engineering Across the Stack:** From optimizing data pipelines to tuning API interactions, I enjoy working on the full lifecycle of applications, connecting the dots between front-end and backend.

**Solving Real-World Problems:** Whether it's creating a specialized rendering engine or fine-tuning vision AI algorithms, I love turning complex challenges into functional and scalable solutions.

### üåü Things I am working on
Without naming specifics, here‚Äôs a glimpse of some of the complex and exciting projects I‚Äôve been working on:  
- **Previewer Renderer for a visual no-code platform:** Developing a rendering engine to preview user-generated content (using drag interfaces) in real-time like FlutterFlow. 
- **Local on-device algorithm (with vision AI):** Crafting a specialised algorithm to run on-device (mobile devices) for real-time image processing engineered for the firearms industry.
- **Realtime geo-tracking:**: Building a real-time geo-tracking marathon app for marathon runners to track their progress, visualise & analyze metrics realtime, and admin to monitor the event. Working on scaling geo system at scale.
- **Cloud-based generation for white label apps:** Developing a cloud-based system to generate white-label apps for clients with custom branding, features, and configurations. This includes code-gen, on-prem/cloud build system, templating etc.
- **Parser for a language:**: Building interpreter for a small expression (scripting) language for a no-code platform.
- **LSP for Lua:** Rewriting language server for Lua from scratch (for learning).


### üéØ Values and Philosophy  
- **Depth and Breadth:** I believe in mastering the tools of my trade while remaining adaptable to new technologies and methodologies.
- **Passion for Learning:** Whether it's exploring logarithmic complexity or understanding the intricacies of a compiler, I‚Äôm always on a journey to expand my knowledge.
